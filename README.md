# Project-2

We propose to map and show how Tesla charging stations have been growing at a similar rate as the Tesla stock (TSLA). This connection could show how by investing in infrastructure, Tesla can continue its significant gains. These gains can be tricky to see, especially when comparing a stock price with physical locations. Using our gained knowledge, we will synthesize the information to make a concise argument for the hypothesis. Even though this idea is simple, we can modify it to become more involved by using other variables such as tesla showrooms (dealerships) and competitor charging stations.
